# Mazed
## 3D Maze game
_implemented in Scala using JMonkeyEngine_

To run, go to the [releases](https://github.com/ezoerner/mazed/releases) page and download the latest
assembly jar, e.g. `mazed-assembly-X.X.X.jar`.

You can run this jar by double-clicking it on most windowing systems as long as you already have Java installed.

(There is an open issue to create a native launcher for MacOS, Windows, Linux, and other Unix with a bundled Java
runtime.)
